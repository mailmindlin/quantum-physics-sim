quantum-physics-sim
===================

Simulator for atoms

This is the website branch. It should not be merged with branch master UNDER ANY CIRCUIMSTANCES!!!

Directory descriptions:
- /demo/ A demo of the simulator. It is tightly tied to the master branch.
- /beta/ A beta version of the demo folder, so I don't break all that I have.

Beta improvements:
==================

Faster loading (about 600%)
Modular Scripts (NFS/NYI)
New layout (NYI)
