					To use this is pretty easy.
					<br/>
					Just type in the chemical symbol for the atom in the 'element' colunm, and type in the cartesian coordinates to the x y and z fields (scientific notation & decimals supported).
					To add anoter atom, push <code>tab</code> on the last textbox on the last row. If a box turns red, hover over it to find out the problem.
					The data is updated realtime (ish).

					Good question. As of the time of this being written, it wasn't functional at all (makes these instructions hard to write)! If the simulator is functional
					or semi-functional when you read this, then please submit an issue <a href="https://github.com/mailmindlin/quantum-physics-sim/issues/new">here</a>, so I remember.
